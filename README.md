# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Binary Classification

This project demonstrates binary classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM) with both linear and RBF kernels on a 2D dataset. It includes data preparation, training, visualization of decision boundaries, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation using cross-validation.

## üìÅ Files

- Task_7.ipynb: Main Jupyter notebook containing the entire workflow and analysis.

## üöÄ Features

- Load and prepare a synthetic 2D binary classification dataset.
- Train SVM models using linear and RBF kernels.
- Visualize the decision boundaries for both kernels.
- Tune hyperparameters such as C and gamma using GridSearchCV.
- Evaluate models using accuracy score and cross-validation.

## üõ† Libraries Used

- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## üìä Workflow

1. *Data Preparation*: Generate synthetic 2D dataset using make_classification.
2. *Model Training*: Fit SVM with linear and RBF kernel.
3. *Visualization*: Plot decision boundaries using matplotlib.
4. *Hyperparameter Tuning*: Use GridSearchCV for optimal C and gamma.
5. *Evaluation*: Accuracy and k-fold cross-validation.

## üîß Hyperparameters Tuned

- C: Regularization parameter
- gamma: Kernel coefficient for RBF

## ‚úÖ Results

- Visual comparison of decision boundaries.
- Improved performance with tuned RBF kernel.
- Insights into model generalization using cross-validation scores.

## üìå How to Run

1. Open Task_7.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
2. Run all cells in sequence to reproduce the results.
